# Algorithm

## Space & Time Complexity 

### Space Complexity
How much memory is used?

### Time Complexity
Hom much primitive operations are executed?

::: tip
with respect to input size<br>
and assuming worst case scenario
:::

| **Name** | constant | logarithmic | linear | quadratic | exponential |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Notation** | O(1) | O(logn) | O(n) | O(n^2) | O(k^n) |

### Native API
#### JS
- map/linear/shift()/unshift() in their core linear time
- push/ constant
- sort nlog(n) (it depends)
- .length is just a property lookup, so is constant time
